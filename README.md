# go-amqp-reconnect

auto reconnecting library for https://github.com/streadway/amqp, that doesn't reconnect on server shutdown
To simply developers, here is auto reconnect wrap with detail comments.

This library based on https://github.com/isayme/go-amqp-reconnect, but also supports some external methods.

## Methods

1. rabbitmq.Dial(url) & rabbitmq.DialConfig(url, config) - creates connection with reconnect
2. connection.Channel() - creates channel with reconnect
3. connection.Close() - clearly closes channel without reconnect
4. channel.Qos() - restore settings for channel
5. channel.QueueDeclare() & channel.QueueDeclarePassive() - restore autoDeleted queues
6. channel.ExchangeDeclare() & channel.ExchangeDeclarePassive() - restores autoDeleted exchanges
7. channel.Close() - clearly closes channel without reconnect

Another methods call through aliases with mutex, to avoid race condition

## How to change existing code
1. add import `import "github.com/AsidStorm/go-amqp-reconnect/rabbitmq"`
2. Replace `amqp.Connection`/`amqp.Channel` with `rabbitmq.Connection`/`rabbitmq.Channel`!

## Debug

You can set `rabbitmq.Debug = true` variable to view debug messages

## Settings

1. `rabbitmq.ReconnectDelay` determines time that app wait for new reconnect try, defaults to `time.Second * 3`

## Examples

### Close by developer
> go run examples/close_by_developer/demo.go -url=amqp://user:password@host:port/

### Close with reconnect
> go run examples/close_with_reconnect/demo.go -url=amqp://user:password@host:port/

after start, drop connection through RabbitMQ management panel on connection tabs, or restart RabbitMQ server

### Graceful Shutdown
> go run examples/graceful_shutdown/demo.go -url=amqp://user:password@host:port/

after start try to interrupt with (Ctrl or Cmd + C) app, see that all messages processed and only after that all connections closed
